All tiles are 16x16

Probably all entities need a reference to the tilemap to check for collision
EDIT: Every entity has an OnTileMapCollide(Rectangle tile) method

Every frame, the tilemap checks the collision of all its tiles. 
If something is colliding with the tilemap, it'll call its OnTileMapCollide method with the
rect of the tile it collided with as the argument.
Different entities will respond differently to colliding, so this is smart

The game runs natively at 255 x 224, the scale just determines the size of a pixel
